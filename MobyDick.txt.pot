msgctxt "986"
msgid "the same time what could I think of a harpooneer who stayed out of a"

msgctxt "994"

msgctxt "997"
msgid "Arter that, Sal said it wouldn't do. Come along here, I'll give ye a"

msgctxt "998"
msgid ""
"glim in a jiffy;\" and so saying he lighted a candle and held it towards"

msgctxt "999"

"me, offering to lead the way. But I stood irresolute; when looking at a"

msgctxt "1002"
msgid "come; WON'T ye come?\""
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1003"
msgid ""
"I considered the matter a moment, and then up stairs we went, and I was"

msgctxt "1004"
msgid "ushered into a small room, cold as a clam, and furnished, sure enough,"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1005"
msgid ""
"with a prodigious bed, almost big enough indeed for any four harpooneers"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1006"
msgid "to sleep abreast."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1007"
msgid ""
"\"There,\" said the landlord, placing the candle on a crazy old sea chest"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1008"
msgid "that did double duty as a wash-stand and centre table; \"there, make"

msgctxt "1009"
msgid "yourself comfortable now, and good night to ye.\" I turned round from"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1010"
msgid "eyeing the bed, but he had disappeared."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1011"
msgid ""
"Folding back the counterpane, I stooped over the bed. Though none of the"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1012"
msgid "most elegant, it yet stood the scrutiny tolerably well. I then glanced"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1013"
msgid "round the room; and besides the bedstead and centre table, could see"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1014"
msgid "no other furniture belonging to the place, but a rude shelf, the four"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1015"
msgid "walls, and a papered fireboard representing a man striking a whale. Of"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1016"
msgid "things not properly belonging to the room, there was a hammock lashed"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1017"
msgid ""
"up, and thrown upon the floor in one corner; also a large seaman's bag,"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1018"
msgid ""
"containing the harpooneer's wardrobe, no doubt in lieu of a land trunk."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1019"
msgid ""
"Likewise, there was a parcel of outlandish bone fish hooks on the shelf"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1020"
msgid ""
"over the fire-place, and a tall harpoon standing at the head of the bed."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1021"
msgid "But what is this on the chest? I took it up, and held it close to the"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1022"
msgid ""
"light, and felt it, and smelt it, and tried every way possible to arrive"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1023"
msgid "at some satisfactory conclusion concerning it. I can compare it to"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1024"
msgid "nothing but a large door mat, ornamented at the edges with little"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1025"
msgid "tinkling tags something like the stained porcupine quills round an"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1026"
msgid "Indian moccasin. There was a hole or slit in the middle of this mat,"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1027"
msgid ""
"as you see the same in South American ponchos. But could it be possible"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1028"
msgid "that any sober harpooneer would get into a door mat, and parade the"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1029"
msgid ""
"streets of any Christian town in that sort of guise? I put it on, to try"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1030"
msgid "it, and it weighed me down like a hamper, being uncommonly shaggy and"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1031"
msgid ""
"thick, and I thought a little damp, as though this mysterious harpooneer"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1032"
msgid "had been wearing it of a rainy day. I went up in it to a bit of glass"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1033"
msgid ""
"stuck against the wall, and I never saw such a sight in my life. I tore"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1034"
msgid ""
"myself out of it in such a hurry that I gave myself a kink in the neck."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1035"
msgid "I sat down on the side of the bed, and commenced thinking about this"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1036"
msgid ""
"head-peddling harpooneer, and his door mat. After thinking some time on"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1037"
msgid ""
"the bed-side, I got up and took off my monkey jacket, and then stood in"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1038"
msgid "the middle of the room thinking. I then took off my coat, and thought"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1039"
msgid ""
"a little more in my shirt sleeves. But beginning to feel very cold now,"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1040"
msgid "half undressed as I was, and remembering what the landlord said about"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1041"
msgid "the harpooneer's not coming home at all that night, it being so very"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1042"
msgid ""
"late, I made no more ado, but jumped out of my pantaloons and boots, and"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1043"
msgid ""
"then blowing out the light tumbled into bed, and commended myself to the"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1044"
msgid "care of heaven."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1045"
msgid "Whether that mattress was stuffed with corn-cobs or broken crockery,"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1046"
msgid ""
"there is no telling, but I rolled about a good deal, and could not sleep"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1047"
msgid "for a long time. At last I slid off into a light doze, and had pretty"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1048"
msgid ""
"nearly made a good offing towards the land of Nod, when I heard a heavy"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1049"
msgid "footfall in the passage, and saw a glimmer of light come into the room"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1050"
msgid "from under the door."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1051"
msgid "Lord save me, thinks I, that must be the harpooneer, the infernal"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1052"
msgid ""
"head-peddler. But I lay perfectly still, and resolved not to say a word"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1053"
msgid "till spoken to. Holding a light in one hand, and that identical New"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1054"
msgid "Zealand head in the other, the stranger entered the room, and without"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1055"
msgid ""
"looking towards the bed, placed his candle a good way off from me on the"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1056"
msgid "floor in one corner, and then began working away at the knotted cords"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1057"
msgid "of the large bag I before spoke of as being in the room. I was all"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1058"
msgid "eagerness to see his face, but he kept it averted for some time while"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1059"
msgid "employed in unlacing the bag's mouth. This accomplished, however, he"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1060"
msgid "turned round--when, good heavens! what a sight! Such a face! It was of"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1061"
msgid "a dark, purplish, yellow colour, here and there stuck over with large"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1062"
msgid "blackish looking squares. Yes, it's just as I thought, he's a terrible"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1063"
msgid "bedfellow; he's been in a fight, got dreadfully cut, and here he is,"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1064"
msgid "just from the surgeon. But at that moment he chanced to turn his face"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1065"
msgid "so towards the light, that I plainly saw they could not be"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1066"
msgid "sticking-plasters at all, those black squares on his cheeks. They were"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1067"
msgid ""
"stains of some sort or other. At first I knew not what to make of this;"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1068"
msgid ""
"but soon an inkling of the truth occurred to me. I remembered a story of"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1069"
msgid ""
"a white man--a whaleman too--who, falling among the cannibals, had been"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1070"
msgid ""
"tattooed by them. I concluded that this harpooneer, in the course of his"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1071"
msgid ""
"distant voyages, must have met with a similar adventure. And what is it,"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1072"
msgid ""
"thought I, after all! It's only his outside; a man can be honest in any"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1073"
msgid "sort of skin. But then, what to make of his unearthly complexion, that"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1074"
msgid ""
"part of it, I mean, lying round about, and completely independent of the"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1075"
msgid ""
"squares of tattooing. To be sure, it might be nothing but a good coat of"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1076"
msgid "tropical tanning; but I never heard of a hot sun's tanning a white man"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1077"
msgid ""
"into a purplish yellow one. However, I had never been in the South Seas;"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1078"
msgid ""
"and perhaps the sun there produced these extraordinary effects upon the"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1079"
msgid ""
"skin. Now, while all these ideas were passing through me like lightning,"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1080"
msgid "this harpooneer never noticed me at all. But, after some difficulty"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1081"
msgid ""
"having opened his bag, he commenced fumbling in it, and presently pulled"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1082"
msgid ""
"out a sort of tomahawk, and a seal-skin wallet with the hair on. Placing"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1083"
msgid "these on the old chest in the middle of the room, he then took the New"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1084"
msgid ""
"Zealand head--a ghastly thing enough--and crammed it down into the bag."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1085"
msgid ""
"He now took off his hat--a new beaver hat--when I came nigh singing out"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1086"
msgid ""
"with fresh surprise. There was no hair on his head--none to speak of at"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1087"
msgid "least--nothing but a small scalp-knot twisted up on his forehead. His"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1088"
msgid "bald purplish head now looked for all the world like a mildewed skull."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1089"
msgid ""
"Had not the stranger stood between me and the door, I would have bolted"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1090"
msgid "out of it quicker than ever I bolted a dinner."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1091"
msgid "Even as it was, I thought something of slipping out of the window, but"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1092"
msgid "it was the second floor back. I am no coward, but what to make of"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1093"
msgid "this head-peddling purple rascal altogether passed my comprehension."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1094"
msgid "Ignorance is the parent of fear, and being completely nonplussed and"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1095"
msgid ""
"confounded about the stranger, I confess I was now as much afraid of him"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1096"
msgid "as if it was the devil himself who had thus broken into my room at"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1097"
msgid "the dead of night. In fact, I was so afraid of him that I was not"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1098"
msgid "game enough just then to address him, and demand a satisfactory answer"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1099"
msgid "concerning what seemed inexplicable in him."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1100"
msgid "Meanwhile, he continued the business of undressing, and at last showed"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1101"
msgid ""
"his chest and arms. As I live, these covered parts of him were checkered"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1102"
msgid ""
"with the same squares as his face; his back, too, was all over the same"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1103"
msgid "dark squares; he seemed to have been in a Thirty Years' War, and just"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1104"
msgid "escaped from it with a sticking-plaster shirt. Still more, his very"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1105"
msgid "legs were marked, as if a parcel of dark green frogs were running up"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1106"
msgid "the trunks of young palms. It was now quite plain that he must be some"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1107"
msgid "abominable savage or other shipped aboard of a whaleman in the South"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1108"
msgid ""
"Seas, and so landed in this Christian country. I quaked to think of it."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1109"
msgid ""
"A peddler of heads too--perhaps the heads of his own brothers. He might"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1110"
msgid "take a fancy to mine--heavens! look at that tomahawk!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1111"
msgid "But there was no time for shuddering, for now the savage went about"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1112"
msgid ""
"something that completely fascinated my attention, and convinced me that"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1113"
msgid "he must indeed be a heathen. Going to his heavy grego, or wrapall, or"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1114"
msgid ""
"dreadnaught, which he had previously hung on a chair, he fumbled in the"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1115"
msgid "pockets, and produced at length a curious little deformed image with"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1116"
msgid "a hunch on its back, and exactly the colour of a three days' old Congo"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1117"
msgid "baby. Remembering the embalmed head, at first I almost thought that"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1118"
msgid ""
"this black manikin was a real baby preserved in some similar manner. But"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1119"
msgid ""
"seeing that it was not at all limber, and that it glistened a good deal"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1120"
msgid "like polished ebony, I concluded that it must be nothing but a wooden"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1121"
msgid "idol, which indeed it proved to be. For now the savage goes up to the"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1122"
msgid "empty fire-place, and removing the papered fire-board, sets up this"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1123"
msgid "little hunch-backed image, like a tenpin, between the andirons. The"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1124"
msgid "chimney jambs and all the bricks inside were very sooty, so that I"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1125"
msgid ""
"thought this fire-place made a very appropriate little shrine or chapel"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1126"
msgid "for his Congo idol."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1127"
msgid "I now screwed my eyes hard towards the half hidden image, feeling but"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1128"
msgid "ill at ease meantime--to see what was next to follow. First he takes"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1129"
msgid "about a double handful of shavings out of his grego pocket, and places"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1130"
msgid "them carefully before the idol; then laying a bit of ship biscuit on"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1131"
msgid "top and applying the flame from the lamp, he kindled the shavings into"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1132"
msgid ""
"a sacrificial blaze. Presently, after many hasty snatches into the fire,"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1133"
msgid "and still hastier withdrawals of his fingers (whereby he seemed to be"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1134"
msgid ""
"scorching them badly), he at last succeeded in drawing out the biscuit;"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1135"
msgid ""
"then blowing off the heat and ashes a little, he made a polite offer of"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1136"
msgid ""
"it to the little negro. But the little devil did not seem to fancy such"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1137"
msgid "dry sort of fare at all; he never moved his lips. All these strange"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1138"
msgid "antics were accompanied by still stranger guttural noises from the"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1139"
msgid "devotee, who seemed to be praying in a sing-song or else singing some"
msgstr ""

msgid "him--\"Queequeg!\"--but his only answer was a snore. I then rolled over,"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1261"

msgctxt "1262"
msgid "slight scratch. Throwing aside the counterpane, there lay the tomahawk"

msgctxt "1276"
msgid "last, his mind seemed made up touching the character of his bedfellow,"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "1279"
msgid "if it pleased me, he would dress first and then leave me to dress"

msgctxt "1292"

msgctxt "1293"

"movement was to crush himself--boots in hand, and hat on--under the bed;"

msgctxt "1296"

msgctxt "1297"

msgctxt "1299"
msgid "to show off his outlandishness in the strangest possible manners. His"

msgctxt "1300"
msgid ""
"education was not yet completed. He was an undergraduate. If he had not"

msgctxt "1303"

"last, he emerged with his hat very much dented and crushed down over his"

msgctxt "2801"

msgctxt "2802"
msgid "and drawing forth the ship's articles, placed pen and ink before him,"

msgctxt "2803"

msgctxt "2804"
msgid ""
"to settle with myself at what terms I would be willing to engage for the"

msgctxt "2805"
msgid "voyage. I was already aware that in the whaling business they paid no"

msgctxt "2806"
msgid ""
"wages; but all hands, including the captain, received certain shares of"

msgctxt "2807"

msgctxt "2808"
msgid "degree of importance pertaining to the respective duties of the ship's"

msgctxt "2809"
msgid "company. I was also aware that being a green hand at whaling, my own"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2810"
msgid ""
"lay would not be very large; but considering that I was used to the sea,"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2811"
msgid "could steer a ship, splice a rope, and all that, I made no doubt that"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2812"
msgid "from all I had heard I should be offered at least the 275th lay--that"

msgctxt "2813"
msgid "is, the 275th part of the clear net proceeds of the voyage, whatever"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2814"
msgid ""
"that might eventually amount to. And though the 275th lay was what they"

msgctxt "2815"
msgid ""
"call a rather LONG LAY, yet it was better than nothing; and if we had a"

msgctxt "2816"

"lucky voyage, might pretty nearly pay for the clothing I would wear out"

msgctxt "2817"

"on it, not to speak of my three years' beef and board, for which I would"

msgctxt "2818"
msgid "not have to pay one stiver."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2819"
msgid "It might be thought that this was a poor way to accumulate a princely"

msgctxt "2820"
msgid "fortune--and so it was, a very poor way indeed. But I am one of those"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2821"
msgid ""
"that never take on about princely fortunes, and am quite content if the"

msgctxt "2822"
msgid ""
"world is ready to board and lodge me, while I am putting up at this grim"

msgctxt "2823"
msgid ""
"sign of the Thunder Cloud. Upon the whole, I thought that the 275th lay"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2824"
msgid "would be about the fair thing, but would not have been surprised had I"

msgctxt "2825"
msgid "been offered the 200th, considering I was of a broad-shouldered make."

msgctxt "2826"
msgid "But one thing, nevertheless, that made me a little distrustful about"

msgctxt "2827"
msgid ""
"receiving a generous share of the profits was this: Ashore, I had heard"

msgctxt "2828"
msgid ""
"something of both Captain Peleg and his unaccountable old crony Bildad;"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2829"
msgid "how that they being the principal proprietors of the Pequod, therefore"

msgctxt "2830"
msgid ""
"the other and more inconsiderable and scattered owners, left nearly the"

msgctxt "2832"

msgctxt "2833"
msgid "shipping hands, especially as I now found him on board the Pequod,"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2834"
msgid "quite at home there in the cabin, and reading his Bible as if at his"

msgctxt "2836"
msgid ""
"jack-knife, old Bildad, to my no small surprise, considering that he was"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2837"

msgctxt "2848"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "2850"
msgid "the slightest consideration will show that though seven hundred and"

msgctxt "2851"
msgid "seventy-seven is a pretty large number, yet, when you come to make"

msgctxt "3499"
msgid "glances."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "3500"
msgid "\"Elijah,\" said I, \"you will oblige my friend and me by withdrawing. We"

msgctxt "3507"
msgid "\"Never mind him,\" said I, \"Queequeg, come on.\""

"Struck by this plain matter-of-fact question, I answered, saying, \"Yes,"

msgid "Once more we quitted him; but once more he came softly after us; and"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "3523"
msgid "At last, stepping on board the Pequod, we found everything in profound"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "3524"
msgid "quiet, not a soul moving. The cabin entrance was locked within; the"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "3525"
msgid "hatches were all on, and lumbered with coils of rigging. Going forward"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "3526"
msgid "to the forecastle, we found the slide of the scuttle open. Seeing a"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "3527"
msgid "light, we went down, and found only an old rigger there, wrapped in a"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "3528"
msgid ""
"tattered pea-jacket. He was thrown at whole length upon two chests, his"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "3529"

msgctxt "3531"
msgid "\"Those sailors we saw, Queequeg, where can they have gone to?\" said I,"

msgid ""
"looking dubiously at the sleeper. But it seemed that, when on the wharf,"

msgctxt "3533"
msgid "Queequeg had not at all noticed what I now alluded to; hence I would"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "3534"
msgid "have thought myself to have been optically deceived in that matter,"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "3535"
msgid ""
"were it not for Elijah's otherwise inexplicable question. But I beat the"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "3536"
msgid ""
"thing down; and again marking the sleeper, jocularly hinted to Queequeg"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "3537"
msgid ""
"that perhaps we had best sit up with the body; telling him to establish"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "3538"
msgid ""
"himself accordingly. He put his hand upon the sleeper's rear, as though"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "3539"
msgid "feeling if it was soft enough; and then, without more ado, sat quietly"

msgctxt "3540"
msgid "down there."

msgctxt "3541"
msgid "\"Gracious! Queequeg, don't sit there,\" said I."

msgstr ""

msgctxt "3548"
msgid "Queequeg removed himself to just beyond the head of the sleeper, and"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "3549"
msgid "lighted his tomahawk pipe. I sat at the feet. We kept the pipe passing"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "3550"
msgid ""
"over the sleeper, from one to the other. Meanwhile, upon questioning him"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "3551"
msgid "in his broken fashion, Queequeg gave me to understand that, in his"

msgctxt "3552"
msgid ""
"land, owing to the absence of settees and sofas of all sorts, the king,"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "3553"

msgid ""
"that respect, you had only to buy up eight or ten lazy fellows, and lay"

msgctxt "3556"
msgid ""
"them round in the piers and alcoves. Besides, it was very convenient on"

msgctxt "3557"
msgid ""
"an excursion; much better than those garden-chairs which are convertible"

msgctxt "3558"
msgid "into walking-sticks; upon occasion, a chief calling his attendant, and"

msgctxt "3561"

"While narrating these things, every time Queequeg received the tomahawk"

msgid "\"Perry easy, kill-e; oh! perry easy!\""
msgstr ""

msgctxt "3565"
msgid "He was going on with some wild reminiscences about his tomahawk-pipe,"

msgid ""
"which, it seemed, had in its two uses both brained his foes and soothed"

msgctxt "3567"

msgctxt "4598"

msgctxt "4603"
msgid "noticed that all the fish familiar to landsmen have not a flat, but a"

msgctxt "4605"
msgid "though it may be similarly shaped, invariably assumes a horizontal"

msgid "position."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "4607"

"Nor is it at all prudent for the hunter to be over curious touching the"
